# Loan-Payment-Prediction
**To determine whether a loan will default or not.**

This competition asks you to determine whether a loan will default, as well as the loss incurred if it does default. Unlike traditional finance-based approaches to this problem, where one distinguishes between good or bad counterparties in a binary way, we seek to anticipate and incorporate both the default and the severity of the losses that result. In doing so, we are building a bridge between traditional banking, where we are looking at reducing the consumption of economic capital, to an asset-management perspective, where we optimize on the risk to the financial investor by finding out if a loan will be paid off on in collection or not.
